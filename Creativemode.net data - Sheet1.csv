"The following are a set of prompts chosen to test various complexities, request qualities and scope. 
As all the mods were generated using the free welcome credits, multiple accounts were used.

In the case of mob generations, they must declare a vanilla mob as their base, when you see ""Extension of ?:"", that is showing which mob base that prompt used.
